function Pr = ProbKgivenC(A,info,clus)
% Pr = ProbKgivenC(A,info,clus): for each attribute in info, this function
% returns the probability that two randomly chosen people IN THE SAME
% CLUSTER C share attribute K. I.e. we want to compute the probability that
% two people share a certain attribute given that they are clustered
% together.
